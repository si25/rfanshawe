    <p>For Charlie Thacker deciding not to enter the expensive private rental market was an easy choice to make. On a low weekly wage, Thacker chose to move from friends’ sofas to a van, parked on the land where he is currently working as an apprentice market gardener. ‘I could either have gone on housing benefits and got my flat for free and   probably been a bit better off and live in a house in Bristol but I didn’t  even choose to do this really,’ says Thacker. ‘I was looking at some rooms on Gumtree, got some messages back from some people and got accepted to move into a house, but then I saw the van and jumped at the chance, moved in,and don’t regret it at all’.</p>
    
    <p>The vacant van was available to live in, and after haggling the price down to £25 a week, Thacker moved the van to the land where he works, close to Keynsham, near Bristol. It wasn’t just the rental that Thacker saved on, but steep council tax costs and bills that would have priced him out  of the private rental market, even if the monthly payments were manageable. In the van, Thacker relied on burning logs to keep warm and a small generator for electricity.‘It’s very low cost, it’s also a more sustainable way of living, and less damaging to the environment, having no electricity apart from the old generator!  To be honest I probably would have been better off living in a flat but look at it, it’s lovely here isn’t it?’</p>
      
    <p>In the aftermath of the worst economic crisis of our time, with wages stagnant, inflation rising, and house and rental prices increasing year on year, there are also around one million empty buildings across the country.  When squatting in empty residential buildings was criminalised in 2012, it seemed like it couldn’t have come at a worse time. For those relying on the  squatting loophole for a roof over their head, the situation was bleak and protests rife. As recently as November 2013, twenty illegal squatters occupied the most expensive council home   ever to be sold, going for a cool £3m at a smart auction in the Marriott hotel in central London. It’s hardly surprising that people have looked for other more innovative ways to deal with the housing crisis; in the Bristol area, more and more converted vans are appearing around the city’s residential areas.</p>
      

    <p>‘I have seen a lot of young people especially in Bristol sway towards this kind of lifestyle, even though it’s quite frowned upon. Especially since squatting has been illegal I’ve definitely seen a lot more vans around Bristol - you just have to look out for a van with a chimney and you know! ‘In terms of young working people, it’s very difficult. There seem to be all these subsidies for students and people on benefits, people who are coming off drugs, or those who aren’t working, but not enough subsidies for young people who do work hard.’ Thacker says that a common view of people who choose to live alternative lifestyles like him is that it’s a way of avoiding the social obligation of paying their taxes but his choice was not about depending on the state to bail him out, but rather about making it possible to achieve career goals and live in a way that suits him. Instead, he believes there should be more allowance for different ways of living, recognised and accepted by the authorities, including a certain level of tax payment.</p>

 <p>‘I do kind of like being under the radar, but the conversations come up with a few people who say: “you don’t pay any tax, how do you feel about that?” But I wouldn't really mind paying council tax seeing as I’m living so cheap, I understand it needs to be done. It’s one of the reasons I didn't go on benefits even though I would be one of the people who would be benefiting from it rather than abusing it.’</p>
      


 <p>Living this way hasn’t come without its challenges.  With freedom comes the need for resourcefulness, and it’s been a steep learning curve since he moved in. ‘In the winter I was actually quite uncomfortable but that was mainly because I was quite unorganised and I didn't plan it very well: I found the van, moved in immediately, then it started getting cold.</p>
      
 <p>‘When you work and it gets dark at about four or five, you just don’t have any time to prepare things so you're messing about in the dark with an axe which isn't really very safe! Now I’ve been doing it for a little while, I’ve got used to it, and have learnt you can live just as comfortably off-grid, and you do pick up some pretty good skills. I’d never picked up an axe before I moved here and now I’m pretty good with an axe. ‘Even organisation in a way, like preparing all your fire wood the night before - which I never did! - making sure that all the leisure batteries are fully charged so that you have lighting for the evening. Now as the seasons change everything’s going to change too, I’m not going to be worrying about keeping warm but about keeping cool and keeping my food cool,’ says Thacker. The pros outweigh the cons, however, with a lack of contract or mortgage allowing freedom of movement and off-grid living space to breath. Benefiting from being surrounded byfertile land, Thacker grows his own vegetables in an old polytunnel, and will be able to use the fridge van the market garden uses for preserving salad leaves.</p>
      
 <p>The next step for Thacker, who in the spring moved into a caravan he relocated to the same site for £120, is to get a driving license so he could buy his own van and be able to move around, with a future dream for a barge on the canal. But there’s no going back to landlords and four walls.</p>

<p>‘I was saying at the weekend that if I ever had to go back to working in a normal job and live in a normal flat it would break me, I would hate it, I wouldn't know what to do. I’ve only been here for eight months but it definitely seems like the right route, the route that would make me happiest.’</p>
